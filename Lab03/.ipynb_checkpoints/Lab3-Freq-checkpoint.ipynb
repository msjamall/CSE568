    "In data science, we are always interested in understanding the world from incomplete data, in other words from a sample or a few samples of a population at large. Our experience with the world tells us that even if we are able to repeat an experiment or process, we will get more or less different answers the next time. If all of the answers were very different each time, we would never be able to make any predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some kind of answers differ only a little, especially as we get to larger sample sizes. So the important question then becomes one of the distribution of these quantities from sample to sample, also known as a **sampling distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since, in the real world, we see only one sample, this distribution helps us do **inference**, or figure the uncertainty of the estimates of quantities we are interested in. If we can somehow cook up samples just somewhat different from the one we were given, we can calculate quantities of interest, such as the mean on each one of these samples. By seeing how these means vary from one sample to the other, we can say how typical the mean in the sample we were given is, and whats the uncertainty range of this quantity. This is why the mean of the sample means is an interesting quantity; it characterizes the **sampling distribution of the mean**, or the distribution of sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the babies case, the uncertainty in the parameter estimate can be measured by computing the **sampling distribution** of the estimator. \n",
    "What you are doing is sampling many Data Sets $D_i$ from the true population (which we are not given you will argue, and you are right, but just wait a bit), say M of them, each of size N, from some true model $p(\\cdot|\\trueval{\\lambda})$. We will now calculate M $\\est{\\lambda}_i$, one for each dataset. As we let $M \\rightarrow \\infty$, the distribution induced on $\\est{\\lambda}$ is the sampling distribution of the estimator."

    "In the last two decades, **resampling** the ONE dataset we have has become computationally feasible. Resampling involves making new samples from the observations, each of which is analysed in the same way as out original dataset. One way to do this is the Bootstrap. "
